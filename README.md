# Student Exam Pass Predictor ðŸŽ“

This machine learning project uses logistic regression to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on hours studied and class attendance.

## What It Does

- Loads data from a small dataset (real or sample)
- Trains a logistic regression model
- Makes predictions based on study habits
- Evaluates model accuracy
- Visualizes the data with a scatter plot
- Outputs human-readable prediction results
